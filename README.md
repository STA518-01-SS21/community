## community

Discussions related to course content will be held in this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/STA518-01-SS21/community/issues).
Students are welcome and encouraged to post here.
To start a discussion thread, create a new Issue.

Examples of uses for this area are:

- Help with coding
- Clarification on items
- Installing software
- Other types of computational problems

# **Some general advice for opening an Issue on GitHub:**

- First search existing issues for answers (both open and closed).
  If the question already has been answered, you're done!
  Feel free to open a closed Issue if you believe the answer is not satisfactory.
- Give your Issue an informative title:
  - Good: 'Error: could not find find function "ggplot"'
  - Bad: "I need help!", "Things not working", "aaaaaarrrrrgh!"
    Note that you can edit an Issue's title after it has been posted.
- Format your questions using markdown and code formatting.
  Preview your issue prior to posting.
- Where appropriate, provide links to specific files (or lines within them) or an image/screenshot in the body of your Issue.
  This will help your helper understand your question.
  Note that only your instructor has access to private repos.
- (Optional) Tag someone or a group of people.
  Start by typing the `@` symbol and GitHub will generate some good suggestions.
  To tag your instructor, use `@dykesb`; to tag a class/team mate use their GitHub username.
- Click on **Submit new issue** when you are ready to post.

Don't just create Issues, also respond to them!
Your experience might have some valuable insight to add to the conversation; it doesn't have to be in terms of "correctness".

As Issues get resolved, they will be closed.
So don't forget to look in the [closed Issues](https://github.com/STA518-01-SS21/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before posting a new one.
You can use the "Search" feature on this repository to find topics.

Note that this repository is publically available to the everyone in STA 418/518 Section 01 as well as all of GitHub.
While I do not anticipate non-STA 418/518 GitHub users to find this repo, they might still.
If you want to discuss things that are **not** for the entire class, reach out to your instructor
